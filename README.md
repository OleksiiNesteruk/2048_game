# 2048 Game

## Description

This project is an implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Players can move the tiles using the arrow keys, and after each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears in a random empty spot on the grid. The game ends when there are no more possible moves, and the player wins when a tile with the number 2048 appears.
